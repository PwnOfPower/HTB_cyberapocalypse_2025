# Dragon's Fury

## Challenge description

In the epic battle against Malakar's dark forces, the ancient dragons must unleash a series of precise attacks. Each attack round offers several potential damage valuesâ€”but only one combination of attacks will sum up exactly to the damage required to vanquish the enemy.

### Your Task

Read a single string that represents a list of subarrays. Each subarray contains possible damage values for one round.

Example:
```
[[13, 15, 27, 17], [24, 15, 28, 6, 15, 16], [7, 25, 10, 14, 11], [23, 30, 14, 10]]
```

- Read an integer `T` that represents the target total damage required.
- Pick exactly one number from each subarray so that their sum equals `T`.
- It is guaranteed that there is exactly one valid solution.
Output the valid combination (as a list) that meets the target damage.

### Example
Input:
```
[[13, 15, 27, 17], [24, 15, 28, 6, 15, 16], [7, 25, 10, 14, 11], [23, 30, 14, 10]]
77
```
Output:
```
[13, 24, 10, 30] 
```
Explanation:

The input represents 4 rounds of attacks, each with a list of possible damage values. The unique valid solution is the combination `[13, 24, 10, 30]` which sums exactly to 77.


## Solution

```python
from itertools import product
from typing import List

# Input the text as a single string
input_list = input()  # Example: "shock;979;23"
input_int = input()

# Write your solution below and make sure to encode the word correctly
damage_values = eval(input_list)
damage = int(input_int)

def quest(xss, x):
    for combination in product(*xss):  # generate all possible combinations
        if sum(combination) == x:
            return list(combination)  # return the first valid combination

print(quest(damage_values, damage))

```

## Test Example
Attack Options:
```
[[20, 14, 12, 19], [10, 30, 18], [18, 25, 11, 28, 14], [27, 10, 28, 22, 12], [18, 30]] 134
```
Battle Result:
```
[19, 30, 28, 27, 30]
```

## Flag
```
HTB{DR4G0NS_FURY_SIM_C0MB0_59c11cf03b523d04faffb4dddba259aa}
